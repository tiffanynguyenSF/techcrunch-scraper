## üß† TechCrunch Scraper ‚Äî AI & Startup Funding Tracker

This Colab notebook automatically scrapes **TechCrunch** news articles related to **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **startups**, and **venture funding**.  
It was developed during my **Master‚Äôs in Finance and Data Analytics** to support valuation research for **Arith Inc.**, an AI startup developing patented chip technology.

The notebook collects and analyzes TechCrunch data to identify:

- üì∞ **Latest AI and tech startup news**  
- üí∞ **Funding amounts and rounds** (detected from article titles containing ‚Äúraises‚Äù or ‚Äúraised‚Äù)  
- üìÖ **Publication timelines** for market trend visualization  


### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

**Scrapes data** from multiple TechCrunch categories:  
- [https://techcrunch.com/category/startups/](https://techcrunch.com/category/startups/)  
- [https://techcrunch.com/category/venture/](https://techcrunch.com/category/venture/)  
- [https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/)

**Extracts key fields:**
- `Title` ‚Äî the article headline  
- `Date` ‚Äî publication date  
- `URL` ‚Äî direct article link  

**Filters** for relevant keywords such as *‚Äúraises‚Äù* and *‚Äúraised‚Äù* to focus on **funding news**.  

**Exports** all data into an Excel file (`latest_techcrunch.xlsx`) for further financial analysis or trend modeling.
